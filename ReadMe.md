# ScrewDefaultButtons
A simple jQuery plugin that allows you to replace default radio buttons and checkboxes with designs of your own.

**NOTE** ScrewDefaultButtons version 2 is not backwards compatible. It has been written from the ground up and does some things differently. If you prefer using version 1, I've kept the old site running here: http://screwdefaultbuttons.com/version1

## How it works
Be sure to link to jQuery and then your copy of the ScrewDefaultButtons plugin. Here is an example:

	<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js"></script>
	<script src="js/jquery.screwDefaultButtons.js"></script>
